## Sherry Infotech Internship Task
Instructions:
1. Install Django ( ​https://www.djangoproject.com/​ ) on your system. A simple pip command would do this for
you easily. We use Python 3.6 for our development but you can also develop this assignment on Python 2+.
2. Create a github ( ​https://github.com/​ ) repository, if you don’t have one already.
3. Use HTML to create a simple page with two input fields and two buttons. There will be bonus points if you
use libraries like Bootstrap to align the fields in columns and make them visually appealing.
4. The first button should be able to submit a form with these two input fields and save it in the database. By
default, Django provides a SQLITE ( ​https://www.sqlite.org/index.html​ ) database, which you can use.
5. The second button requires you to submit an AJAX POST ( ​https://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/​ ) request with
the same data as present in the input fields. AJAX allows for data transfer without page refresh, which is
useful in large-scale applications. On successful POST request, show a small alert
6. Your input fields should have basic data validation. A user should not be able to submit the data if any of the
fields are left blank.
7. On successful completion of this app, upload this on Github as a public repository. Make one commit for the
README file and the other one to update the code. You are welcome to start with the app directly on Github
and build it step-by-step while adding commits to your repository.
8. Share the link of the repository to the Director, Apoorva Sharma, before the deadline.
